# A Github Query Project Application

## Tasks to be accomplished in this exercise :
- [x] Add the INTERNET permission.
- [x] Call getResponseFromHttpUrl and display the results in mSearchResultsTextView.
- [x] Surround the call to getResponseFromHttpUrl with a try / catch block to catch an IOException.

### NOTE : For this there would be no output, as the network calls on MainThread/UIThread would throw NetworkOnMainThreadExecution.
